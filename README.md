 Kent-state-student-retention


Worked on student retention and graduation for Kent state university. Before building any models, it was important to get the data in working condition. So, started with data exploration, data preparation and cleaning. For the model building part, I created multiple logistic regression models to predict retention and graduation of the students after each and every semester.
